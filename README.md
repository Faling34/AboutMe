# 👋 Hey, I'm Chris!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I'm a passionate **FiveM developer** based in Germany 🇩🇪, creating immersive multiplayer experiences with Lua and custom server-side logic.

## 🚓 What I Do

- 🔧 Develop custom **FiveM scripts** and **resources**
- 🧠 Focus on performance, modularity, and player experience
- 🌍 Build and manage **RP servers** with unique mechanics
- 🛠️ Work with **Lua**, **HTML/CSS**

## 📫 Connect with Me

- 💬 Discord: `Soon`  

## ⚡ Fun Fact

I believe great RP scripts should feel invisible—seamless, intuitive, and immersive.  
If players forget they're using a script, I've done my job right. 🎮
